<p>Begun in 1999, <a href="http://www.opennms.org">OpenNMS</a> an enterprise scale
monitoring solution written in Java, with a Postgresql database and
configured with XML files. --- Because it uses SNMP OpenNMS can monitor
most servers, network gear, and other appliances without needing a
custom agent. Its <a href="http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Features_List">feature list</a>
is impressive.</p>

<h3>When monitoring, less is more.</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of monitoring products in production over the years,
both proprietary and open source. Most suffer from information overload
because folks set out trying to monitoring everything. They believe
they can catch all problems early, but this never works. Staff are
inundated with so many alerts, most of them false, that searching for
legitimate ones becomes a full time job, or worse, alerts are
intentionally ignored. If you are monitoring or plan to start, start
small, very small, and grow slowly.</p>

<h3>What I like about OpenNMS</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>No message storms. OpenNMS has message correlation, multiple
messages meaning the same thing result in only one alert. A feature
called critical path ensures that multiple and different messages
result in only one alert. For example, if a router is identified as
a critical path, OpenNMS will not generate a storm of alerts for
all hosts behind the router if it goes down.</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial support. OpenNMS creators offer paid support and
consulting services. For do-it-yourselfers, there is a <a href="http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Mailing_lists">mailing
lists</a>, a <a href="http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Tutorial">wiki</a>,
and the #opennms IRC channel at <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Scale and stability. OpenNMS was designed from day one to scale to
thousands of nodes at low cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Simple to install. I was able to install and run OpenNMS on a small
virtual host without difficulty.</p></li>
<li><p>SNMP. OpenNMS is not limited to servers supported by a custom
agent. By using SNMP, OpenNMS can support servers, network gear,
storage gear, UPS gear, and so much more. For those of you who
think that SNMP is long in the tooth, look at SNMP version 3, with
more functionality and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol#Version_3">full encryption</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>#</h1>

<h3>What I don&#39;t like about OpenNMS</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#39;m not a fan Java. I&#39;ve been disappointed by many Java
applications over the years, but I had no such disappointment with
OpenNMS. The installation process is easy. One problem I did
encounter, with no solution yet, is that OpenNMS does not start a
boot, no matter what I tried. I resorted to having CFEngine promise
to keep it running.</p></li>
<li><p>Editing XML files sucks. XML was not made for people to ready
continuously.</p></li>
<li><p>Merging XML files for upgrades sucks more. When I upgraded OpenNMS
I was faced with the frustrating exercise of merging the upgrades
with my preexisting changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Confusing documentation. The wiki is often outdated or incomplete.
There is a <a href="https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennmsbook">book</a>, but it
was not easy to find.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>#</h1>

<p>Every monitoring product I&#39;ve worked with has things I don&#39;t like, so
don&#39;t think I&#39;m singling OpenNMS out. We are now using OpenNMS to
monitor our gear at Evolve and OpenNMS is at the top of my list for any
future monitoring projects.</p>

            <title>Polling CFEngine with Opennms</title>

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>In the coming months I&#39;m going to work with and write about <a href="http://www.opennms.org">Opennms</a>.
Started in 1999, Opennms is a mature, open source, enterprise scale
monitoring system. --- In this first installment I offer you a way to
monitor CFEngine&#39;s cf-serverd on any host. Since cf-agent typically
promises that cf-serverd running, knowing that cf-serverd is running
tells you that the agent is working.</p>

<p>In my install, Opennms keeps most of its configuration files in
/etc/opennms. First edit capsd-configuration.xml, adding the following
section.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;protocol-plugin protocol=&quot;Cfengine&quot; class-name=&quot;org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.plugins.TcpPlugin&quot; scan=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
   &lt;property key=&quot;port&quot; value=&quot;5308&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;property key=&quot;timeout&quot; value=&quot;2000&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;property key=&quot;retry&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/protocol-plugin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Second, edit poller-configuration.xml adding these sections.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;service name=&quot;Cfengine&quot; interval=&quot;300000&quot; user-defined=&quot;false&quot; status=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
   &lt;parameter key=&quot;retry&quot; value=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;parameter key=&quot;timeout&quot; value=&quot;3000&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;parameter key=&quot;port&quot; value=&quot;5308&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;parameter key=&quot;rrd-repository&quot; value=&quot;/opt/opennms/share/rrd/response&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;parameter key=&quot;rrd-base-name&quot; value=&quot;cfengine&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;parameter key=&quot;ds-name&quot; value=&quot;cfengine&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;

&lt;monitor service=&quot;Cfengine&quot; class-name=&quot;org.opennms.netmgt.poller.monitors.TcpMonitor&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Restart Opennms, then you can manually rescan hosts immediately, or
wait for Opennms to do so in it&#39;s own time, usually overnight.</p>

new?[/caption]</p>

<p>Sharp viewers will notice that my node is an IPV6 node. Opennms
supports IPV6, an important considering in the coming years.</p>
