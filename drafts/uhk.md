What's the story?
Pain?

What's the lead?
Pain cured but chief aggravator of typing and mousing remained.

Pain. A few years ago I suffered from tendinitis, first in my right elbow then in my right wrist. Typing and mousing aggravated it. Physio therapy brought me relief, after many months, along with changing how I type and mouse. I'm a touch typist and try to avoid the mouse if I can, I learn shortcut keys, or program my own. But that blasted rodent is still required for some programs, and reaching to the far right would aggravate my wrist over time. I had to find a solution.

First I tried ten keyless keyboards (no number pad). Without a number pad, the mouse is closer to me. This helped but typing was still problem, causing my wrist to flare up after high volume typing days. I had a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_ergonomic_keyboards#Natural_Keyboard](Microsoft Natural) keyboard years ago and I did find it comfortable, but it had a number pad making the mouse a problem. I wanted to find an angled keyboard like the MS one that was also ten keyless. I found a few options and settled on the [https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/](Ultimate Hacking Keyboard). The UHK has two halves that you can angle, space, and tilt for your comfort. But there's more.

The Good

App

Having less keys than even a ten keyless, you have to make some concessions about seldom used keys. But the UHK's key programming app is a game changer. You can program any key for any key value or key combination. The app is multi platform (Linux, Windows, OSX), but the best part is that the app is only for changing the keys, not for running the keyboard. Your changes are stored in the keyboard so they go wherever you go and no special drivers are needed. There's even an [http://ultimatehackingkeyboard.github.io/agent/#/keymap/QWR](online demo).

Maps and Layers

Press the mouse key and a letter key will function as a mouse up event. If your patient you can mouse without the mouse. Press the mod key and a letter key will function as a cursor up arrow. This is concept of layers. Layer keys change the function of of other keys. Maps are the all the layers bundled together into a logical unit that the keyboard uses. You can have multiple maps, make your own, and change them on the fly. The keyboard comes with several maps pre-configured. But wait there's more.

Macros

Macro allow you string multiple key combination together. Probably useful for gaming and I found it useful for Windows work. More later.

Switches

Mine are brown style, not Cherry brand, but very similar to the brown Cherries on my ten keyless. A good spring with a subtle click that won't annoy your cubemates.

Multiple tilt options

You can install the titling legs in multiple places. I chose to tent my halves so my wrist are at a neutral angle.

Two halves

Moving the halve apart combined with the different tilting angles means my wrist are straight. The mouse between the halves is a more natural movement and does not aggravate my wrist. This arrangement is very comfortable and did not take long to get used to.

Curious co-workers

"Oooh cool keyboard." Get use to hearing that a lot.

Bad

Map LED display hard to read

TODO pic

A LED display on the left half shows the current map. There are LEDs on the same pad that show the current mod mode too. Sadly, the map display is hard to read. In a bright office the off LED segments are white which stands out almost as much as on red.

Spanning cable pulls halves together

Being able to position the two halves of the UHK is amazing, but the spiral cable that joins them is springy and tends to pull them back together. The cable uses two 4 pin RJ11 connectors so you can make your own longer cable cheaply.


Ugly

The UHK case has a few colour options and I ordered orange. Sadly the orange is mustard yellow. 

Tips if you're like me

I use Linux and Vim daily, and sometimes Windows. I've made a few layer changes that you might find useful.

By default the escape key requires a two key layer combination. Untenable for Vim use. I changed the mouse key to escape. Holding the mouse key still gets me the mouse layer keys, but I seldom use them.

The default cursor keys in the mod layer are set up in WASD style but on the right hand side. I changed them to match the HJKL movements of Vim.

The ctrl-alt-del Windows combo requires four keys on the UHK because deletes is on the mod layer. I created a macro so the L key in mod mode does ctrl-alt-del.

Final

The price of the UHK is high, but the build quality and thoughtfulness of its design is very high. For me it was a good buy.
