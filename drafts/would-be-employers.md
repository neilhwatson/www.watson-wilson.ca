# TODO: write to 'you' or be more distant?

There's plenty of advice for job seekers but little advice for would be employers. Being a contractor for over ten years I've gone through a lot of job searches, interviews, and negotiations, and I say that not all that is wrong with the job market rests at the candidate's feet. Employers make plenty of mistakes too. Here are the most common ones I see.

1. Keep your job description brief. Succinctly state your top required skills and briefly describe a few common duties. Walls of text can drive candidates away; they can find them too daunting or worry that the employer does not know what they want.

1. Be up front about money. There's no point in spending time interviewing a candidate if both parties aren't aligned on compensation. Employers should not be coy about money. 'How much do you make?' can be insulting. A budget for the role already exists; tell the candidate what it is.

1. Don't interrogate a candidate for that one True Answer. Technical interviews should be discussions of problems and solutions. Sometimes I get troubleshooting scenario questions where the interviewer wants to learn how I think or how deep I can go, yet rather than judging me on my answers the interviewer will not drop the scenario, even when the time is running out, until he gets the exact answer he wants.

1. The more people interview a candidate, the less likely there will be a consensus on that candidate. Are 6 people, two of them executives, required to hire one non-manager?

1. Can't find good candidates? Stop posting in public places (Job boards) hoping a random stranger that you like, and that has the skills you desire, happens by. Instead post in peer online groups, or go out to local peer meetups and get to know people.

1. Give constructive feedback to candidates you don't pick, or how will they improve? Make candidates into better candidates for the next role.

1. Act quickly. Countless times I've seen employers take weeks to schedule multiple interviews, and to produce offers. By the time they contact me for the 'next stage' I've already signed on somewhere else. Good candidates are quickly snapped up, perhaps by competitors.
