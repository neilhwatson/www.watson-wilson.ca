I've built [cfbot](https://github.com/neilhwatson/cfbot) an open source
IRC helper bot for the #cfengine channel at [Freenode](http://freenode.net).
The bot returns definitions of submitted keywords.

I invite you to contribute to this knowledge sharing project. Here are
some cfbot examples:

   09:09 !cfbot help 09:09 -cfbot:#cfengine- help=Usage: !cfbot will
   return information about the keyword. I am case insensitive. Try !cfbot
   topics to see a list of available topics.

   09:09 !cfbot about 09:09 -cfbot:#cfengine- about=I am a Perl script
   running under Irssi. I am open source:
   https://github.com/neilhwatson/cfbot See Help for more info.

   09:10 !cfbot topics 09:10 -cfbot:#cfengine- Available topics: About,
   Best Practices, Bugs, DH, DR, EFL, Frameworks, Help, NCF, Rudder,
   Support `
