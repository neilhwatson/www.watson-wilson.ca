I used to power my site with [Movable Type](https://movabletype.org/), but that was removed from Debian. I have another site that is powered by [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com), but maintaining it is costly. I have to constantly be on top of security issues, and the built in editor is tedious for a console cowboy like me. I do not use hosting services, because doing it myself helps keep my skills sharp.

After some research I decided to return to static pages, but with a twist. There are tools that will build static pages from templates allowing me to separate content from display, but without the overhead of a database. Further, static pages increase my security.

I first looked at [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's Ruby powered and well documented, but the pages it builds to not include tags that are so common in blogs. More searching revealed [Statocles](http://preaction.me/statocles/).

Statocles is like Jekyll, but power by Perl and does tags. Being a long time Perl hacker this was a perfect fit for me.
