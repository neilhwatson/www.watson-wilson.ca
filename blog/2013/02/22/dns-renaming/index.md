title: Avoid the cost of renaming hundreds of hosts

Your hosts are named after your data centre. Now you must move hundreds of hosts to another data centre. Do you rename them or abandon the naming convention?

A client of mine is facing this challenge. I've discussed host naming before.. Host are not static. They change functions and locations. Think ahead before naming them.
