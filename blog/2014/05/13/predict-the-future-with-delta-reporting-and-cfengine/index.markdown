promises repaired and host count.[/caption]

Until now Delta Reporting was only able to show you the outcome history
of all your promises. Now it can show you the future. --- DR's new
trending reports reveal how many promises will be kept, repaired, or
not kept in the future. It will also show you how many hosts you'll
have the in future. Combined, these reports show a clear picture of how
well you are doing at keeping promises in the face of host population
growth.
