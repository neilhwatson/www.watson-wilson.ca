title: Delta Reporting 6 months in production

![candy_time](http://watson-wilson.ca/static/images/candy_time.jpg)

Zero downtime and zero data loss in six months of Delta Reporting in
production at Evolve Thinking. And DR is just getting better. In those
six months we've added a dashboard, promises summary reports, an
extensive development test suite, and promise and host trending graphs.
And today we release 2.6 with improved SQL injection protection.
