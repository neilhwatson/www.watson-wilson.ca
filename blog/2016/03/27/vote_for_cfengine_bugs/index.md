CFEngine has switched to a
[JIRA bug system](https://tracker.mender.io/projects/CFE/summary) and this
system allows us to vote for bugs. I encourage you to vote for your favourite
bugs; here are mine:

1. [2033](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/CFE-2033) YAML data files are not
   parsed correctly. I hope to make EFL work with YAML data files.
1. [85](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/CFE-85) and 
   [86](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/CFE-86) involve cf-agent's inability
   to log promise outcomes. 
1. [1520](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/CFE-1520) is a whole list of IPv6
   related bugs. While CFEngine does work with IPv6, IPv6 is a second class
   citizen.
