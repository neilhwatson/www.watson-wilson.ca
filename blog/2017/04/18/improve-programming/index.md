title: Improve your Python, Perl, or Ruby
tags: programming, scripting, python, perl, ruby, shell

Learn Python, Perl, or Ruby by example with my production focused templates. Each template can be object or procedural, has standard CLI options, documentation, and is test driven.

- Python

- Perl

- Ruby
