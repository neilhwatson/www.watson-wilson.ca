Learn Python, Perl, or Ruby by example with my production focused templates. Each template can be an object or procedural, has standard CLI options, documentation, and is test driven.

- Python [sample program](https://github.com/neilhwatson/nustuff/tree/master/python/app), and [cheatsheet](https://github.com/neilhwatson/nustuff/blob/master/python/cheatsheet.md)

- Perl [sample program](https://github.com/neilhwatson/nustuff/tree/master/perl/app), and [cheatsheet](https://github.com/neilhwatson/nustuff/blob/master/perl/cheatsheet.pod)

- Ruby [sample program](https://github.com/neilhwatson/nustuff/tree/master/ruby/app), and [cheatsheet](https://github.com/neilhwatson/nustuff/blob/master/ruby/cheatsheet.md)

You'll find more examples inside the Perl, Python, and Ruby directories.

### Shell bonus

I prefer not to write extensive shell programs (they are much messier than other languages), but when I do I have a [template](https://github.com/neilhwatson/nustuff/blob/master/shell/skel.sh) and [cheatsheet](https://github.com/neilhwatson/nustuff/blob/master/shell/cheatsheet.md) for that too.
