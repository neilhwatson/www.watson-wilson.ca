## Evolve Thinking is shutting down in March 2016

Evolve Thinking is shutting down. The website and email are going out
of service.

1. EFL, Delta Hardening, and Delta Reporting will be transfered to
   [Neil's github account](https://github.com/neilhwatson). Neil will continue
   to maintain and support these products.

1. Neil will honour any outstanding work for Evolve customers.

1. All of Neil's writings on the Evolve site have been migrated to his
   [personal website](http://watson-wilson.ca).

Thank you to those who have supported Evolve.
